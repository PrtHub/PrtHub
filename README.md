# Hi there 👋 I'm Pritam

I'm a front-end developer passionate about building interactive and user-friendly web applications.

- 🌱  I’m working on React and trying to build some great-looking web applications like (https://github.com/PrtHub/Tripma). I have learned everything from youtube (youtube channels: JavaScript Mastery, Code with Harry, FreeCodeCamp, Webdev simplified, Claver programming) and on my own. That's why I'm not afraid to take challenges. I challenged myself everytime to make something better than before, It's another thing that I do not get success in everything but I learn something everytime. Sometimes I use ChatGPT to solve my problem or any code error, I asked about great colors, great font, etc. I first started learning Web development on November 24, 2022. Then, I wanted to do both Frontend and Backend but slowly my interest moved towards the Frontend because of DSA.So far, it's been a great journey, I hope it will continue with the same and get a Frontend dev job.
